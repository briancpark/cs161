# CS 161

CS 161 is Computer Security at UC Berkeley. I took this offering in Fall 2021 under Raluca Ada Popa and Nicholas Weaver. This repo contains my development setup and notes.

There is no source code here and the submodules are made private. Please DO NOT contact me for source code.

## Installation

Project 1 requires a virtual machine on x86 machine.

Project 2 requires Golang to be installed. It can be installed from the [official website](https://golang.org/doc/install). The project was developed on Go 1.17. Works for both x86 and Apple Silicon!

Project 3 requires no installation, since it was a CTF challenge done on the web. The project is no longer reproducable since the assignment is over.
